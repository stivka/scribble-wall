Try sending canvas changes on every mouse action and certain time interval.
With this approach there is not need to reconstruct the drawing paths,
which is problematic and may results in different results in the session
where the input is given and sessions where it is recieved.

The core question is, that what is the time interval after which 
data is updated?

Differential, high-frequency updates

Probably need to use Operational Transformation (OT)
Consider using ShareDB which is specifically designed for OT https://github.com/share/sharedb

To not run out of bandwidth consider: 
* user cap
* close idle websocket sessions with timeout
* a toggle for drawing mode to open websocket session with those clients,
whereas others are viewers

One cop-out is going with locking areas and not allowing more than one editor 
in that area at once.
